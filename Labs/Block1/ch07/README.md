# Chapter 7: Control Flow (loops)

**Lab 7.2A:** Take a user's string as input and print it out to them if the first char is a printable char

**Lab 7.2B:** Take a user's number, if it is negative print it out in binary, if it is positive print it binary and then make it negative and print it in binary

**Lab 7.2C:** Take two positive numbers from the user, if they are equal then error, else assign the greater value to a third value. If the sum of all 3 is greater than 2 then display all the values

**Lab 7.2D:** Take in two numbers and an operator from the user on one line. then using the operator in a switch case to decide the math that needs to be done and do it.

**Lab 7.3A:** Redo a previous lab and use a for loop to make it simpler

**Lab 7.3B:** Take an array with multiple phrases seperated by new lines and print the phrases out one char at a time and stop at a new line.

**Lab 7.3C:** Take a user's input one char at a time using a do while loop and save into an int array (only accept letters). Take each char and capitilize it. Print the array one char at a time using a for loop

**Lab 7.4A:** Take a number from the user and print up to 20 numbers that it is divisible by. Repeat until they input a number over 999

**Lab 7.5A:** Take an input from the user saying evens or odds using a do while loop. Then print all numbers from 1 to 100 of the specified type
