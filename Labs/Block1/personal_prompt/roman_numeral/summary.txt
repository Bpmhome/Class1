This is a program that converts roman numerals to decimal and vice versa. The program displays a menu for the user to choose which action they want. For changing the decimal to Roman the program starts subtracting the largest Roman Numeral it can for as many times as it can counting each time. It then uses the number of times it did this as the queu to write the roman numerals. It repeats this all the way down to 1. Then the other conversion reads the current letter and interpets it by reading the next corresponding characters to decide the value of that portion of the number. This value is then added to the number. That is it.
