I made a program that takes a float input from the user and changes it into a string describing the number. It does
this by taking in the number as a char array to be able to look at each postion of the number. Using its position and
distance from the decimal point we can decide what place it is. I use two functions to return the number value as a string (5 = five).
Once after the decimal it displays the numbers as a fraction.
