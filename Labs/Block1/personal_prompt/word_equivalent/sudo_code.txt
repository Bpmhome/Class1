Prompt:
(Writing the Word Equivalent of a Check Amount)
One common security method requires that the check aount be both written in
numbers and "spelled out" in words. Even if someone is able to alter the numberical amount of the 
check, it's extremely difficult to change the amount in words. Write a program that inputs a numeric
check amount and writes the word equivalent of the amount. For example, the amount 52.43
should be written as
FIFTY TWO and 43/100
